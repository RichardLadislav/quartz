## MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)

The **unified [[Parkinsonova nemoc|Parkinson's disease]] rating scale** (UPDRS) is used to follow the longitudinal course of [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease"). The UPD [rating scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scale "Rating scale") is the most commonly used scale in the clinical study of [Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease "Parkinson's disease").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parkinson%27s_disease_rating_scale#cite_note-1)

The UPDRS is made up of these sections:[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parkinson%27s_disease_rating_scale#cite_note-2)

- Part I: evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood
- Part II: self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food
- Part III: clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation
- Part IV: complications of therapy
- Part V: [Hoehn and Yahr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoehn_and_Yahr_scale "Hoehn and Yahr scale") staging of severity of Parkinson's disease
- Part VI: [Schwab and England ADL scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwab_and_England_ADL_scale "Schwab and England ADL scale")

These are evaluated by interview and clinical observation. Some sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.

Clinicians and researchers alike use the UPDRS and the motor section in particular to follow the progression of a person's Parkinson's disease. Scientific researchers use it to measure benefits from a given therapy in a more unified and accepted rating system. Neurologists also use it in clinical practice to follow the progression of their patients' symptoms in a more objective manner.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Parkinson%27s_disease_rating_scale#cite_note-3)

Following the UPDRS scores over time provides insight into the patient's disease progression. For instance [Michael J. Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox "Michael J. Fox")'s symptoms started with a slight tremor, so his motor score would have been less than 10. For most patients, the "mentation, behavior and mood" scores increase later in the disease, but a subset exists for whom those symptoms develop e
