[Empirical Mode Decomposition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/empirical-mode-decomposition "Learn more about Empirical Mode Decomposition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is the process to decompose the whole data set in to number of components that satisfies [Intrinsic Mode Functions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/intrinsic-mode-function "Learn more about Intrinsic Mode Functions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (IMF). Hung et al. described that IMF should be satisfied that (1) The Number of Extreme (Maxima or Minima) to be equal to Number of Zero Crossings or they can differ by one (at most). (2) The mean of local Maxima envelop and [local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum "Learn more about local minima from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") envelop to be zero. EMD Method adapts the time scale between successive local extremes to define intrinsic oscillatory modes. IMF generates the baseline low frequency trend line to be eliminated from the input signal resulted only the [high frequency components](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/high-frequency-component "Learn more about high frequency components from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [53].
