Rusz et al. reported that reduced melody variations can be related to the lowered ability of stress pronunciation and emotional intonation limitation caused by the presence of [[Hypokinetick√° dysartrie|HD]]. Later, according to Watson and Munson, PD speakers exhibit overall lower speech intensity, deficits in intensity range, and intensity variations during speech production [241]. In addition to that, in 2011, Skodda et al. proposed a gender-related study of [[dysprosody]] in PD [217] comprising 169 PD patients and 64 age-matched HC and reported a reduction in speech intensity during a reading task composed of 4 sentences.
