Rusz et al. [196] demonstrated that even in the early stages of [[Parkinsonova nemoc|PD]], patients do exhibit lower melody and decreased intensity variations referring to limited range of motions and impaired laryngeal tension in combination with insufficient breath support [180]. Results of this study indicated that patients in the early stage of PD can suffer primarily from prosodic impairment, which is in accordance with the findings of Harel et al. [109] stating that poor intonation had been observed in several individuals years before the onset of cardinal parkinsonian motor symptoms.

Rusz et al. reported that reduced melody variations can be related to the lowered ability of stress pronunciation and emotional intonation limitation caused by the presence of [[Hypokinetick√° dysartrie|HD|]].
